## About

Inure is an Android application package manager irrespective of whether they're installed or not, it
can scan through any app's internal components and modify them on the go. It also packs a nice
looking Terminal Emulator, Usage Stats, Split/APK Installer and various other tools and many of them
are waiting to be implemented as well.

Inure's development was started as an independent learning project which later has become one of the
most ambitious and intuitive Android apps developed by a single person and is based 100% on custom
UI APIs developed to be used only in this app with its own native theme engine, crash handler, image
renderer and a beautiful animation framework.

Along with it own UI perks, Inure also supports dynamic Material You colors with split accent and
theme color modes.

Currently, the app is in beta testing stage. You can join app's early beta testing
from [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.simple.inure) and
its [Telegram Group](https://t.me/inure_app_manager) for development related discussions.
